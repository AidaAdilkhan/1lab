come down to the BLACK SEA
SWIMMING WITH ME AH-ooh, ooh
go down with me, fall with me
lets make it worth it, ag-ooh, ooh

a thousand nights have passed
change doesn't happens overnight
not visible at first (no)
it's important to hold on, hold on

ooh, ooh
inhect your to me
ooh, ooh
incinerate our shackles

come down to the BLACK SEA
SWIMMING WITH ME AH-ooh, ooh
go down with me, fall with me
lets make it worth it, ag-ooh, ooh
You rise, I fall
I stand, you crawl
you twist, I turn
Who's the first to burn?
you sit and stay
I don't obey
Where do we land in the Blak sea
Ooh, ooh, in the Black sea
Where do we land in the Blak sea
