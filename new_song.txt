go down with me, fall with me
incinerate our shackles
ooh, ooh
it's important to hold on, hold on
you twist, I turn
I don't obey
come down to the BLACK SEA

go down with me, fall with me
go down with me, fall with me
ooh, ooh

change doesn't happens overnight
come down to the BLACK SEA
Where do we land in the Blak sea
inhect your to me
inhect your to me
you sit and stay
I don't obey

go down with me, fall with me
go down with me, fall with me
ooh, ooh

Where do we land in the Blak sea
ooh, ooh
ooh, ooh
inhect your to me
SWIMMING WITH ME AH-ooh, ooh
go down with me, fall with me
a thousand nights have passed

go down with me, fall with me
go down with me, fall with me
ooh, ooh
